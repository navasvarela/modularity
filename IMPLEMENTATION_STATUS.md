# Implementation Status

This document outlines the current implementation status of the Modularity library, highlighting completed features and those that need further implementation.

## Completed Features

1. **Project Structure**:

   - Basic library structure with required dependencies
   - Modular architecture with separate components
   - Appropriate trait bounds and generics

2. **Core Type Definitions**:

   - `ModularInt` struct with generic type parameter
   - `MontgomeryContext` for Montgomery reduction
   - `BarrettContext` for Barrett reduction
   - Extension traits for both reduction techniques

3. **Configuration**:

   - Feature flags for hardware acceleration
   - Feature flags for arbitrary-precision arithmetic

4. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation for public functions
   - README with usage examples
   - Benchmarking setup

## Needs Implementation

   - Implement carryless multiplication

4. **Optimization**:

   - Optimize for specific modulus forms (e.g., Mersenne primes)
   - Add constant-time operations for cryptographic safety
   - Implement specialized algorithms for power-of-2 moduli

5. **Testing**:

   - Expand unit tests to cover edge cases

2. Complete the Montgomery reduction implementation
3. Implement Barrett reduction
4. Add comprehensive unit tests
5. Optimize for performance using hardware intrinsics

## Notes for Implementation

- For hardware acceleration, check AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual for `mulx` and related instructions
- For Montgomery multiplication, use the algorithm from Handbook of Applied Cryptography (Chapter 14)
- For Barrett reduction, refer to Barrett's original paper and modern implementations
- Consider timing attacks when implementing for cryptographic applications
